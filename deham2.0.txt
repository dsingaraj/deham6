Snooker world rankings were first published by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, the governing body for professional snooker, for players on the main tour for the 1976–77 season. Before this, the defending champion was seeded first, and the previous year's runner-up second, for each tournament. For the 1976–77 snooker season, players' performances in the previous three World Snooker Championships (1974, 1975, and 1976) contributed to their points total. Ray Reardon, having won the championship in each of the three years considered, was ranked first, with the maximum possible 15 points, followed by Alex Higgins (pictured), the 1976 runner-up, on nine points.
